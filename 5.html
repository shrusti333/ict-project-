<tr><td>During another summer with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter is expelled from Hogwarts after using 

magic to save himself and Dudley Dursley from Dementors. Harry is whisked off by a group of wizards including Mad-Eye Moody, Remus Lupin, and several new faces, 

including Nymphadora Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt, to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the home of his godfather, Sirius Black. The building also serves as the 

headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore which informs Harry that the Ministry is oblivious to Lord Voldemort's 

return. At the Order's headquarters, Sirius mentions that Voldemort is after a special object he did not have during his previous attack.


Harry's expulsion is reversed 

at a hearing of the Ministry of Magic, and he returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year and learns that Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed a new Defence 

Against the Dark Arts professor: Dolores Umbridge. Umbridge immediately clashes with Harry, and punishes him for his "lies" by forcing him to write a message with a 

magic quill, scarring his hand. Despite the concern of his best friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, Harry refuses to report Umbridge's punishment to Dumbledore, 

who has mysteriously distanced himself from Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Harry, Hermione, and Ron form a secret group to 

train students in defensive spells, calling themselves "Dumbledore's Army". Umbridge tasks the Slytherin students with exposing the group. Meanwhile, Harry and Cho 

Chang develop romantic feelings for each other.


Harry has a vision involving an attack upon Arthur Weasley, from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that 

Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs Severus Snape to give Harry Occlumency lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. 

However, it does not work, but Harry accidentally uses the charm against him, and Snape angrily dismisses him because of this. The connection causes Harry to further 

isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius' deranged Death Eater cousin, escapes from Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters. At 

Hogwarts, Umbridge and her "Inquisitorial Squad" expose Dumbledore's Army by forcing Cho to drink Veritaserum. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge 

becomes the new Headmis
